## Biography
I am currently a final year (2019-2020) master student in the School of Geophysics and Information Technology, China University of Geosciences, Beijing.

My research lies at the intersection of geophysics and artificial intelligence. I am dedicated to designing data-efficient learning methods for seismic data processing and analysis.  

**Now, I'm Looking for Ph.D. position in geophysics.**
